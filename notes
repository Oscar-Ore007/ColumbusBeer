Flow of project 
1. Welcome the user to ColumbusBeer. 
2. Ask the User what specific beer they would like for me to look up?
3. I will then get the information from the API, SAve it to I can use it later and then Display all of the options?
4. Then allow the user to choose a number or which defintion best associates with their needs, and it can then tell them more information about their beer selection 
5. Just for fun, we're going to have a history of all the beers the user has searched.
